			Early History
		</h3>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first cemetery in the Philippines was established in Manila in 1594, shortly after the start of the Spanish colonial period. It was dubbed as the Campo Santo. The location of the first cemetery was in the present-day Intramuros, the walled city of Manila. The first cemetery was destroyed in 1945 during the Battle of Manila. The oldest existing cemetery is the Campo Santo de Laoag, established in 1572 in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte.
